                    <p>I was born in England, but moved to the Eastern Cape in South Africa when I was 7. I grew up in East London until I finished school. </p>
                    
                    <p>In 2016, I  moved to Stellenbosch to study engineering and start a new chapter of my life. In 2021 I met Magdaleen, and we got married the next year. We live on a farm, just outside of Stellenbosch, with a beautiful view of the mountains.</p>

                    <p>I matriculated at Selborne College in 2015. I then started studying at Stellenbosch University and completed my bachelor’s in mechatronic engineering in 2019.</p>

                    <p>I continued with a masters degree, which was upgraded to a PhD. At the end of 2022, I completed my PhD, called, “Accelerating deep reinforcement learning for autonomous racing”.</p> 

                    <p>I have since continued at Stellenbosch as a postdoctoral researcher. My area of interest is the intersection of analytical and machine learning models. </p>
