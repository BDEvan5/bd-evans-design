                <p>I was born in England, but moved to the Eastern Cape in South Africa when I was 7. I grew up in East London and matriculated at Selborne College in 2015. </p>
                
                <p>In 2016, I moved to Stellenbosch to study engineering and start a new chapter of my life. In 2019, I completed my bachelorâ€™s in mechatronic engineering. In 2020, I started a masters in electronic engineering, which was later upgraded to a PhD. </p>
                
                <p>In 2021 I met Magdaleen, and we got married in March 2022.</p>
                
                <p>At the end of 2022, I completed my PhD and continued as a postdoctoral researcher. </p>
