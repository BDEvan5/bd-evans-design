                    <p>I currently work as a research scientist at <a href="https://instadeep.com">InstaDeep</a>.</p>


                    <p>I work in the research team on projects involving various aspects of machine learning, such as
                        large language models, multi-modal models, funetuning, and reinforcement learning. </p>

                    <p>After completing my PhD in machine learning for robotics, I continued in my lab as a postdoctoral
                        researcher at Stellenbosch from February 2022 to February 2023. </p>

                    <p>As a postdoc, I had the opportunity to expand my skills in reinforcement learning, programming,
                        and writing articles for publication. I was fortunate to publish 3 journal articles and 2
                        conference papers.</p>

                    <p>In 2020 I started with a masters degree, which was upgraded to a PhD. At the end of 2022, I
                        completed my PhD, called, “Accelerating deep reinforcement learning for autonomous racing”.</p>

                    <p>During my PhD, I discovered my love for research and machine learning.</p>
