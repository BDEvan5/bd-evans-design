                <p>In 2016, I moved to Stellenbosch and started studying a bachelor's in mechatronic engineering. </p>

                <p>After graduating in 2019, I continued with a masters degree, which was upgraded to a PhD. At the end of 2022, I completed my PhD, called, “Accelerating deep reinforcement learning for autonomous racing”.</p> 

                <p>During my PhD, I discovered my love for research and machine learning.</p>

                <p>I went to high-school at Stelborne College in East London, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. I matriculated in 2015 with academic honours.</p>

                <p>During school, my main sport was rowing, I also played rugby, hockey and squash and did debating. </p>

                <p>Since I was small, I had always wanted to be an engineer and in high-school maths was my favourite subject.</p>
